1.  Run the simulation first---\> file name: 0_simRsNLME_truemodel

2.  Run the automated fitting --\> file name: combined_run_scenarios(test)

    Explore with different:

        -   models (nca, truemodel ...etc)
        -   sampling schemes
        -   Frels
        -   NSubjects

3.  After you make several scenarios you can use file name: reading_results.R
